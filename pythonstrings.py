# You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

# print("It's alright")
# print("He is called 'Johnny'")
# print('He is called "Johnny"')

# a = "Hello"
# print(a)

# assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

#  a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
# consectetur adipiscing elit,
# sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
# ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
# print(a)

# or three single quotes:



# Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

#Strings are Arrays [list to store]
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a[1])



# Looping Through a String
# for x in "banana":
#   print(x)
 
# we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.



# String Length
# To get the length of a string, use the len() function.

# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(len(a))

# number of characters in the line



# Check String
# spelling name and adding a spcecial symbol that proves if spelled right

# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# print("free" in txt)

# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# if "free" in txt:
#   print("Yes, 'free' is present.")



# Check if NOT
# to check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present

# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# print("expensive" not in txt)

# txt = "The best things in life are free!"
# if "expensive" not in txt:
#   print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")



# Slicing

# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[2:5])

# total no of chars 12
# 1st index is 6 because to not print "hello, "
# aaab
# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[-6:0])

# this is a new change

# Upper Case
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.upper()) 

# lower case
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.lower())

# Remove Whitespace
# a = " Hello, World! "
# print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"

# Replace String
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.replace("H", "J"))

# Split String
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']
