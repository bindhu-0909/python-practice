# there are three numeric types in Python:

# int
# float
# complex

# x = 1    # int
# y = 2.8  # float
# z = 1j   # complex

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# containing one or more decimals.-float

# x = 1.10
# y = 1.0
# z = -35.59

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))

# scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

# x = 35e3
# y = 12E4
# z = -87.7e100

# Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

# x = 3+5j
# y = 5j
# z = -5j

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))

# Convert from one type to another:

#  x = 1    # int
# y = 2.8  # float
# z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
# a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
# b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
# c = complex(x)

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)

# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# print(type(c))

# but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
# import random
# print(random.randrange(1, 10))
