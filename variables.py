# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x)
# print(y)

# x = 4         # x is of type int
# x = "Sally"  # x is now of type str
# print(x)

# x = str(3)    # x will be "3"
# y = int(3)    # y will be 3
# z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
# print(x)
# print(type(x))
# print(y)
# print(type(y))
# print(z)
# print(type(z))

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))

# to find data type use (type(-))

# both single and double qoutes are same 
# x = "john"
# is same as
# x = 'john'

#Variable names are case-sensitive.

# a = 4
# A = "Sally"
# both are not same 



# variables have legal and ilegal names
# names with underscore, letters, and no from 0-9 are legal
# myvar = "John"
# my_var = "John"
# _my_var = "John"
# myVar = "John"
# MYVAR = "John"
# myvar2 = "John"

# names with - , and starting with numbers are ilegal
# 2myvar = "John"
# my-var = "John"
# my var = "John"


# variables are case sensitive 

# having 3types : camel case 
#       Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
#      myVariableName = "John"
# : pascal case
#       Each word starts with a capital letter:
#        MyVariableName = "John" 
# : snake case
#      Each word is separated by an underscore character:
#      my_variable_name = "John"



# variables have multiple values
#   should be assigned in one line
#  x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# you can assign the same value to multiple variables
# x = y = z = "Orange"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z) 

#  Unpack a Collection

#  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# x, y, z = fruits
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# () is used for grouping things or functions
# [] is used for lists and getting items from a list 
 

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

# x = "Python"
# y = "is"
# z = "awesome"
# print(x, y, z)

#  when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:
# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x + y)

# print() function is to separate them with commas

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x, y)

# x = "awesome"

# def myfunc():
#   print("Python is " + x)

# myfunc()

# x = "awesome"

# def myfunc():
#   x = "fantastic"
#   print("Python is " + x)

# myfunc()

# print("Python is " + x)
